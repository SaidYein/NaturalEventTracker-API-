### Features

- This is a single page application
- The app uses API to get data from <a href="<https://restcountries.com>/">https://restcountries.com</a>
- A user can enter a country name in to the input field to display the data recieved
- A user can trigger search by either pressing 'Enter' or clicking the search icon on the screen
- A user can see countries and their information listed in different cards on screen
- The country data card includes the following information: Flag, population (in millions), capital and currency
- The country searched is distinguished by its size and its position. (Top layer is the country searched, below layers are neighbors (if ther is any))

### Future Improvements
